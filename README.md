# BattleWise Documentation
## Abstract
BattleWise is a Python game made by ByteWise (Johan and Gleon) along with Nithin. Inspired by the real life board game Battleships, as of now, BattleWise is a single-player, strategic, partly-RPG game where both the player and opponent strategically place ships on a board and attack them by guessing. There are three main characters: Rajat, Genghis Khan and Napoleon Bonaparte who the player faces. These are run in the background by the computer. For more information, read Project Description.

## Project Description
In BattleWise, you play as… yourself. There are three main difficulties: easy, medium, hard and a fourth locked difficulty: nightmare, with each main difficulty having a unique character. Rajat in easy, Genghis Khan in medium and Napoleon Bonaparte in hard. The board sizes for the difficulties are as follows: 4x4 for easy, 5x5 for medium, 6x6 for hard and 7x7 for nightmare.

The player has to place ships on their board, with the enemy (computer) doing the same. Then, both the player and the enemy attack the opponent’s board, trying to hit the ships by guessing. If all ships of one side are destroyed, the other side wins. If the difficulty is set to easy and the player wins, the player doesn’t actually win and instead is moved on to face Nightmare Rajat in nightmare difficulty.

Of course, every character has their own model stored in the resources file, along with the logos. The characters also have their own dialogues with almost every action having one. All dialogues are color coded, with cyan, yellow, red, green and purple text scattered all throughout the game. There are also many funny moments in the game and a couple references too.

## Conclusion
As of now, BattleWise is looking good based on the code and the enjoyability of the game. But there’s a lot that can be improved such as the efficiency of the code, the lore (story), the game mechanics and lowering the repetition of the game.

On the story side, there are plans to expand the backstories of the characters, add a character selection screen and have a different story for each character. Lowering the repetition of the game is very important too, so as to not decrease the enjoyability of the game.

Future implementations include adding tips, different messages for different actions in the game, altering the difficulties and making the game more difficult.
